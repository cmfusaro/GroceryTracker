# GroceryTracker
C++ and python app for tracking amount of groceries sold in a period of time.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This program was solving the problem of parsing data from a grocery store list of items sold and creating different ways to view the data. Also the program would read from an external file and then write data to another file with the totals of each item along side the item names.


What did you do particularly well?

The things I thought that I did particularly well were the trouble shooting and moving through the problems beyond my knowledge base.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think that an enchansment that could have been made would have been to make the racker itself a class level object and by doing this it would be reusable and easy to call and the data would be more secure through encapsulation.


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging piece of code I found were the bits that interacting with C++ and Python. I found that if I was sending/recieving the wrong data type the program would crash and there was little to no explination as to why. The types mismatch in C++ was found quickly with visual studio, but with the two languages working together there was a lot less help given by the IDE.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Transferable skills would be reading and writing to external files. Intergrating multiple languages together. The ability to parse data quickly and efficently. 


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I used clear and easy to understand variable and function names. I add lots of comments that explained the code to make its intent very clear. Adding the project to github allows for the code to be changed with out the fear of loosing it in its current state. Adding function that perform one task at a time make the code easir to maintain and adapt.
